If any further doubts please ask in the comment section
Control for each servo is done by using name tags
for example base servo(bottom servo) can be controlled by using 
name tag+value of servo
for example 
B50 (moves the base servo to 50 degree etc)
All other servos have different name tags inside the code itself
B is for first servo
second is C
third is E
fourth is W
fifth is T
last one(palm) is P
After entering serial monitor set baud rate to 9600 and  select Both NL and CR
The type the value of servo and hit enter
Example
C40 moves the second servo to 40 degree
E50 moves the third servo to 50
